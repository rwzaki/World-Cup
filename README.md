# World Cup Database

This project is one of the required projects within the relational database course at freecodecamp. The main three tasks in this project are:


## **1. Building a database for world cup games and participating teams using PostgreSQL.**

**Files:** _worldcup.sql_

In this task, the database was built using PostgreSQL. It has two table, which are GAMES table and TEAMS table. 


## **2. Inserting data from CSV file into the database using shell script.**

**Files:** _games.csv, insert_data.sh, worldcup.sql_

games.csv has data that are meant to be inserted into the world cup database but using a shell script. Therefore, in this task we had to create insert_data.sh to take games.csv as input and insert the data into the database. 


## **3. Preparing queries using shell script with PostgreSQL to produce some useful statistics.**

**Files:** _queries.sh, worldcup.sql_

In this task, a queries were prepared using PostgreSQL and shell scripting in queries.sh where data was fetched from world cup database.
